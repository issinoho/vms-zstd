/* vms_exit.c - exit() for zstd on OpenVMS.

   With _POSIX_EXIT the VSI C RTL encodes exit(n) as %X35A000 + n*8 + 1,
   which has success severity, so to DCL a failed run looks successful.
   zstd routes exit() here (patch 0002).  Under a Unix shell (GNV bash:
   SHELL is set and is not "DCL") keep the POSIX exit, which the shell
   decodes as $?.  Under DCL, exit code 0 is success, and any other code N
   an error-severity status in the C RTL's POSIX range with the message
   suppressed (%X1035A002 + N*8), so $SEVERITY is 2 and ON ERROR fires; N is
   still (status & %X7F8) / 8.

   Part of the OpenVMS port of zstd (github.com/issinoho/vms-zstd), as in
   vms-wget; distributed under the same terms as zstd (see LICENSE).  */
